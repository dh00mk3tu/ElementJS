# ElementJS
Light Weight Physics Engine for the Web in JavaScript
Work In Progress

## Getting Started
ElementJS started off as an ambitious project long before I called it my final year's major project. I had so many options to go with for my major project but I decided that creating a Physics Engine for the project. I have some really amazing reasons for back my decisions.

    2. Another very cool reason to make a physics engine is it'll help me go over the Physics and Mathematics that I learnt in my engineering. 
    3. Also, the most important point was, that I have no idea how to make a physics engine or what am I supposed to learn even. Best reason.
